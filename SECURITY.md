## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to **responsibly disclose this and NOT open a public issue**.
Please send DM to us (<https://twitter.com/Maximum03400346>).

Please include the details such as causing scope (webapp/worker/package), reproduction, effect, and Severty Vector string.
For valid issues, we will do coordination and disclosure here on GitHub (including using a GitHub Security Advisory when necessary).
